# 180° Analog indicator (from 0 to 100)
## Materials and Tools Required for Production:

### Programs:
  - LightBurn Software
  - PrusaSlicer (or any program, that is compatible with your 3D printer) 

### Tools:
  - Engraving machine or laser engraver
  - 3D printer

### Materials:
  - Wooden plywood for the face (lenght: 220mm, width: 160mm, height: 4 mm, 19 CZK) 
  - Wooden plywood for the stands (the stands are 95 mm x 40 mm, 12 CZK)
  - 3D printer filament (it should use circa 0,62 m of filament and it should take about 15 minutes)

### Electronics:
  - Servo motor MG90S (126 CZK)

### Files:
  - 180_analog_indicator_face.svg (face of the indicator)
  - 180_analog_indicator_stand.svg (stand for the plywood with face)
  - 180_analog_indicator_pointera.STL (pointer)

## Tutorial
1. Open the *180_analog_indicator_face.svg* in LightBurn Software. 
![Face of the indicator](./180_analog_indicator_face.svg)
  - The black parts need to be set to be cut trough. The other parts are suppossed to be burn out at your discretion. The blue dot is fot better adjusting of the plywood on the working space of the engraving machine. Set the dot so it doesnt burn out.
> :warning: While adjusting the plywood on your engraving machine work place, you have to be very precise, because if you place it wrong, the black parts on the sides might not reach the end of the plywood, and you'll ruin your plywood.

2. While your indicator face is engraving, you can print the pointer. Open *180_analog_indicator_pointera.STL* in your prefered program that is compatible with your 3D printer. Set it and you can start printing.

3. When your face of the indicator is done, you can burn the stand. Open the *180_analog_indicator_stand.svg* in LightBurn Software. 
![Face of the indicator](./180_analog_indicator_stand.svg)
  -Set the green parts cut trough, and you can start.

4. Now you should have all parts done.

Now we can put it all together! Let's start.

## Putting it all together
  1. Take your plywood and turn it, and insert the servo inside the hole.

  2. Now take the plywood from the front and put on the pointer on the servo.

  3. As you can see on the picture before, now take your stands. Insert them into the holes. (The holes in the stands should face the holes in the plywood.)
